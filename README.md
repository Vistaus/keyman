keyman
======

A gnome shell extension to access the keyring in a convenient way.

Simply search for your password and copy it to clipboad by clicking it. After a certain
amount of time it will be removed automatically (default is 5 seconds). As this only
works if the keyrings are unlocked, this extension also provides easy access to
lock/unlock keyrings. Finally, this extension provides a history of the last copied
passwords.
