keyman
======

A gnome shell extension to access the keyring in a convenient way.

Simply search for your password and copy it to clipboad by clicking it. After a
certain amount of time it will be removed automatically (default is 5 seconds).
As this only works if the keyrings are unlocked, this extension also provides
easy access to lock/unlock keyrings. Finally, this extension provides a history
of the last copied passwords.
