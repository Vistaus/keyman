# KeyMan

A gnome shell extension to access the keyring in a convenient way.

Simply search for your password and copy it to clipboad by clicking it.
After a certain amount of time it will be removed automatically (default is 5 seconds).
As this only works if the keyrings are unlocked, this extension also provides easy access to lock/unlock keyrings.
Finally, this extension provides a history of the last copied passwords.
